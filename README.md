# My coding journey

## Why ?

The short answer would be: I am a curious human, who has a fascination
for Science and Technology. I'm constantly questioning myself and the
things around me, I've always enjoyed looking for answers to the
lingering questions of my mind. I have multiple fascinations such as:
Physics, Linguistics, Space, Nature, Languages, Computers, Music. (not
so) Surprisingly, my modest skills with computers have helped me a lot
with nourishing those fascinations. In the past I've coded simple
twitter bots to make my friends laugh, I've written simple scripts to
save and segment a live concert to my computer, I've dived into
Arduinos in the past, I've written simple scrappers to get and
organize wallpapers from websites, and a few other things that I can't
recall right now. My take is that computers are a powerful tool and I
wanna dive a little more into it.

## How ?

I've thought about it and, I will start with some Web Development
for a few reasons.

- It is very accessible: lots of content.
- Rewarding: it is very easy to create your first web page and
  sprinkle it with some JS logic.
- I can easily showcase my work to the world since it would
  essentially be WebApps.

  Nowadays a webpage isn't just an HTML document with some CSS attached to
  it. In the next few months I will of course not create a AAA game or
  some revolutionary technology, but I can certainly create some pretty
  cool stuff. I'm still young, once I'm inside of this world, I can dive
  further into it and learn more in depth programming.

## Let's gauuuuur

Let's not procrastinate any further and let's get to work.

I will use this GitHub [Repo](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#html-and-css) to look for some projects.
